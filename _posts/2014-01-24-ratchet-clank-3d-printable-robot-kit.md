Way back in 2011 I built my first ever robot [Sheldon](/journal/rip-sheldon-1-0-hello-sheldon-2-0/ "RIP Sheldon 1.0 â€“ Hello Sheldon 2.0"). I always liked his overall look, so a while back (2012) decided to use his overarching style and structure as basis for a 3D printable robot kit. However as with so many of my projects back then, development was put on the back burner whilst I finished my PhD.

[![](http://localhost:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WP_0009391-1.jpg)](http://localhost:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WP_0009391-1.jpg)

The idea behind the kitâ€™s design is to be an easily extend-able platform that can be utilised to provide basis for many and varied robot builds.

The following outlines a few of the kits features:

- Use of servos for drive rather than the traditional DC motor implementation.
- Allows for both 2 and 4 wheel drive (including tank drive as also shown in the above image).
- Designed to be simply assembled using just a screwdriver.
- Designed to allow the stacking of multiple Arduino shields across multiple levels.
- Caters for multiple Arduino and Netduino types, i.e. Mega, Pro and Uno.
- Mounting provision for numerous sensor types e.g. Sharp IR etc..
- Mini servo mounts for armatures and the like.

Those of you who follow my [facebook page](http://facebook.com/adropinthedigitalocean "dyadica on facebook") may already be familiar with some of the kits elements and may have seen two early stage robots (Ratchet &amp; Clank- as shown in the featured image above) that I built using the kit as a proof of concept test.

Over the next few weeks I aim to devote some much overdue attention to this project and hopefully at the end of development will release the .stl files etc. so that others can also have a go too.

You never know I may even Kickstart it ðŸ™‚
