A very quick example demonstrating the use of the Xbee Explorer Regulated Board as an alternative to the Arduino Xbee Shield for serial communication. My apologies for the sound quality on the video but I have been having a few technical issues.

<div class="video-container"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xs1WL-RxqOs"></iframe></div>The wiring is as follows:

DIN â€“ Port 1  
DOUT â€“ Port 0  
5V â€“ 3V3  
GND â€“ GND

The software in this example can be downloaded via: </blog/netduino-serialporthelper-to-winform-and-xna>

The ArduinoXbeeShield mod can be found via: </blog/arduino-xbee-shield-mod-for-netduino>
