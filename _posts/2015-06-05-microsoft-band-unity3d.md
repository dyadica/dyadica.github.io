In this post I present a video of a plugin which I have been developing recently to enable communication between the excellent [Microsoft Band](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-gb) and the [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/) games development environment.Currently the plugin only works on Android but I hope to have a Windows Phone equivalent finished soon too ðŸ™‚

As you will see in the video; the plugin makes available all the functionality provided by the official [Band SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-gb/developer) (Android) including the ability to create a custom tile on the band that can be used to send instructions to the Unity3D app running on the phone.

I am aiming to make the plugin available in the next week or so; so check back soon and/or [contact me](https://www.facebook.com/ADropInTheDigitalOcean) for more details. Finally, for a great video detailing an overview of the official SDKâ€™s functionality be sure to check out the Band SDK development team [Build 2015](http://www.buildwindows.com/) presentation [here](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015/2-619).
