Hi im batts; For approximately 20 years or so I spent most of my time working as a software engineer and an academic researcher. During this time I specialised in topics such as: games design, virtual and augmented reality, natural user interfaces, assistive technology, IOT and robotics.

I am now semi-retired and taking life a little easier. With that in mind everything I do is just for fun. If you would like to get in touch with me please do so via one of my social media incarnations. You can find the links at the base of each page.
