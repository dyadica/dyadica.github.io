For about the last 20 years or so I primarily worked as a software engineer and academic researcher. During this period I specialised in topics like: games design, virtual &amp; augmented reality, natural user interfaces, assistive technology, IOT and robotics.

I worked on a number of projects (both commercial &amp; research) developing app‚Äôs (desktop &amp; mobile) games (fun &amp; serious) robots and means for human-computer interface. My professional working roles ultimately resulted in an extensive and proven track record for the research, development and realisation of not only computing software and hardware; but the odd physical real-world do-hicky too.

I am now semi-retired üòÄ and thus, taking life a little easier. If you would like to get in touch with me please do so via one of my social media incarnations such as my [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/adropinthedigitalocean "My Facebook Page"). or my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/dyadica) channel.
